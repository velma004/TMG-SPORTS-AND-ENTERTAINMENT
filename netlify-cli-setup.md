# Setting up and Using Netlify CLI for Local Development

Netlify CLI allows you to run your Netlify site and serverless functions locally, simulating the Netlify environment.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. You can check by running:
   ```
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```

2. Install Netlify CLI globally using npm:
   ```
   npm install -g netlify-cli
   ```

## Running Your Site Locally with Netlify CLI

1. Open a terminal and navigate to your project directory (where your `netlify.toml` or project files are located).

2. Run the following command to start the local server:
   ```
   netlify dev
   ```

3. This will start a local server (usually at http://localhost:8888) that serves your static files and runs your Netlify functions.

4. Open your browser and navigate to the local server URL (e.g., http://localhost:8888/admin.html) to access your admin panel with full serverless function support.

## Benefits

- Your serverless functions (e.g., postUpdates, getUpdates) will run locally.
- You can test API calls and dynamic features without deployment.
- Live reload support for frontend changes.

## Additional Commands

- To deploy your site to Netlify:
  ```
  netlify deploy
  ```

- To login to your Netlify account:
  ```
  netlify login
  ```

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter permission issues, try running the install command with `sudo` (Linux/macOS).
- Ensure your functions are in the correct directory (`netlify/functions`).
- Check the Netlify CLI documentation for more details: https://cli.netlify.com/
